        "The research question I have in mind is analysing the variation of the average temperatures for the 12 months over the past 120 years along with monthly and Annual mean temperatures.I want to analyze how the temperature is varying from the past 120 years in Texas.It can gives us idea and information about the climate changes and about global warming. The data of the average temperatures of each and month from year 1900 to 2022 should be collected so that we can analyse the variation of temperatures over the years.The data can be collected with the help of websites in google by using web scraping. I need around 1464 samples of data that is average temperatures for every month for 122 years i.e. from 1900 to 2022 and have saved the data in the from of excel sheet. I have collected my data from the website www.weather.gov. I went to climate and past weather option in the website. Then I have selected location as Houston, Tx and product as Monthly summarized data. And the in the options, I have selected year range from 1900 to 2022, variable as Avg temp and summary as Mean. I saved the data in the table format in the excel sheet. I have took the months as columns and the years as rows so that I got the Avg temperature of a particular month of a particular year in a corresponding cell."

Physical inactivity is a primary cause of most chronic diseases. The initial third of the article considers: activity and prevention definitions; historical evidence showing physical inactivity is detrimental to health and normal organ functional capacities; cause versus treatment; physical activity and inactivity mechanisms differ; gene-environment interaction (including aerobic training adaptations, personalized medicine, and co-twin physical activity); and specificity of adaptations to type of training. Next, physical activity/exercise is examined as primary prevention against 35 chronic conditions [accelerated biological aging/premature death, low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), sarcopenia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, arterial dyslipidemia, hemostasis, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, balance, bone fracture/falls, rheumatoid arthritis, colon cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, polycystic ovary syndrome, erectile dysfunction, pain, diverticulitis, constipation, and gallbladder diseases]. The article ends with consideration of deterioration of risk factors in longer-term sedentary groups; clinical consequences of inactive childhood/adolescence; and public policy. In summary, the body rapidly maladapts to insufficient physical activity, and if continued, results in substantial decreases in both total and quality years of life. Taken together, conclusive evidence exists that physical inactivity is one important cause of most chronic diseases. In addition, physical activity primarily prevents, or delays, chronic diseases, implying that chronic disease need not be an inevitable outcome during life.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"4028900\", \"name\": \"F.

Many of these mutagens and carcinogens may act through the generation of oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals may also play a major role as endogenous initiators of degenerative processes, such as DNA damage and mutation (and promotion), that may be related to cancer, heart disease, and aging. Dietary intake of natural antioxidants could be an important aspect of the body's defense mechanism against these agents. Many antioxidants are being identified as anticarcinogens. Characterizing and optimizing such defense systems may be an important part of a strategy of minimizing cancer and other age-related diseases.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"144825771\", \"name\": \"B.

The cytosolic segment of each IL-1 receptor family member contains the Toll-IL-1-receptor domain. This domain is also present in each Toll-like receptor, the receptors that respond to microbial products and viruses. Since Toll-IL-1-receptor domains are functional for both receptor families, responses to the IL-1 family are fundamental to innate immunity. Of the 11 members of the IL-1 family, IL-1\\u03b2 has emerged as a therapeutic target for an expanding number of systemic and local inflammatory conditions called autoinflammatory diseases. For these, neutralization of IL-1\\u03b2 results in a rapid and sustained reduction in disease severity. Treatment for autoimmune diseases often includes immunosuppressive drugs whereas neutralization of IL-1\\u03b2 is mostly anti-inflammatory. Although some autoinflammatory diseases are due to gain-of-function mutations for caspase-1 activity, common diseases such as gout, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, recurrent pericarditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and smoldering myeloma also are responsive to IL-1\\u03b2 neutralization. This review summarizes acute and chronic inflammatory diseases that are treated by reducing IL-1\\u03b2 activity and proposes that disease severity is affected by the anti-inflammatory members of the IL-1 family of ligands and receptors.\", \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"4224903\", \"name\": \"C.
